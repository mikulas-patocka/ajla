=== RELEASE 0.1.1 ===

Save the JIT-generated machine code to the files in ~/.cache/ajla. This reduces
startup time.

Introduce stdlib/mutex.ajla

Fix crashes on alpha, loongarch64, mips.

Imcompatible change: Fix misdesigned FFI interface - we need to pass the
destructor to the functions that manipulate memory allocated from the
destructor, so that the destructor is not freed prematurely. Previously, the
"keep" statement was used for this purpose, but it is not reliable.
