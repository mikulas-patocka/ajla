=== RELEASE 0.1.2 ===

Fix a bug that the tag bit was not checked on the second argument of
len_at_least and len_greater_than - this resulted in incorrect result if the
value was a box or a thunk.

Optimization: don't check index against list length if it can be proved that the
index is smaller (such as "for i := 0 to len(l) do ...").

=== RELEASE 0.1.1 ===

Save the JIT-generated machine code to the files in ~/.cache/ajla. This reduces
startup time.

Introduce stdlib/mutex.ajla

Fix crashes on alpha, loongarch64, mips.

Imcompatible change: Fix misdesigned FFI interface - we need to pass the
destructor to the functions that manipulate memory allocated from the
destructor, so that the destructor is not freed prematurely. Previously, the
"keep" statement was used for this purpose, but it is not reliable.

=== RELEASE 0.1.0 ===
